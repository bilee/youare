# youare
text based project incorporating multimedia elements 

part 1 is web page--  http://wiredhill.com/youare.htm

I want to re-create it using Processing programming language (https://processing.org/), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language)

Also want to include audio elements (each line read by different person), use vocoder or synthesized voice, text-to-speech...

Create video and music incorporating theses elements;

create an art installation to showcase the project;

Add more phrases so the viewer cannot tell when it loops
